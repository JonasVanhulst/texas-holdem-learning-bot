> **Note:** This project was completed during the second year (2022-2023) of my studies as a learning exercise to practice **object-oriented programming (OOP)** in C++. The instructor provided the core game logic, and my task was to implement and integrate the bot logic.

# Texas Hold’em Poker Bot 🎲

**Learning project** focused on developing a poker-playing bot for **Texas Hold’em** in **C and C++**.  
The project demonstrates the transition from C to C++, improving programming skills, understanding game logic, and learning **object-oriented programming** (OOP) concepts in C++.

## Project Overview

### Phase 1 – texas holdem C Version

- The **game logic** (rules, hand evaluation, etc.) was provided by the instructor.
- My task: implement the **bot logic** that makes decisions during the game.
- Project structure:
  - `main.c` – handles program flow and user interaction with my implementation of the bot
- Focus: learning **C programming**, game logic integration, and struct-based modular coding.

### Phase 2 – texas holdem C++ Version

- The game logic was rewritten by the instructor using **object-oriented programming (OOP)**.
- My task: rewrite and integrate my bot logic in C++, adapting it to the **OOP design**.
- Project structure:
  - `main.cpp` – program entry and interaction
  - `jonas.cpp` and `jonas.h`, second bot: `jonasVanhulst.cpp` and `jonasVanhulst.h` – my bot implementation, integrated with the instructor’s classes
- Focus: learning **C++**, OOP concepts, class design, and refactoring procedural code to an object-oriented design.

## Gameplay

- Simulates **Texas Hold’em** poker games.
- Bot automatically makes decisions for betting, folding, and hand evaluation.
- Game logic ensures all rules of poker are followed; bot logic determines strategy based on current hand and table state.

---

## Skills Demonstrated

- Programming in **C and C++**
- Understanding and integrating **existing game logic**
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Modular design and file integration
- Game logic and strategy implementation

---

## Technologies

- C / C++
- Console-based application
- Header and source files for modular design

---

## Status

> This is a **learning project** created for educational purposes and portfolio demonstration.
